                The Wikipedia article for Syndesmica is not extensive. It tells you it’s a moth genus, but not much else.
                So I Googled Syndesmica. I got 280 hits, all of which quote the Wikipedia article word for word.
                Then I Google Scholar-ed Syndesmica. I got 3 hits, all of which were about Verruca Syndesmica, the wart common in frogs and toads.
                I couldn’t find Syndesmica in the library catalogue (I tried four different university libraries). I couldn’t find the word Syndesmica in the index of any book about moths.
                I started to think I was going insane.
